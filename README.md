# KeyboardPrototype
My atempt to create a 5 button keyboard. It will alows me to write text on the smartphone using only one hand and without looking at the screen. Of course, I will need a proper case for it, but firstly I will create a prototype software for this purpose.
**Work in progress**

## How it works?
The program works like the T9 dictionary in our old phones. Do you remember the mechanical keyboard that allows you to text? After pressing the sequence of buttons, you write the word. You can turn on the T9 dictionary to write these words faster because the program has suggested you the correct words. My program works in a similar way.

In code are defined 5 buttons and tables with letters for each key. Actually there are also 2 modes.  One to write text by pressing letters one-by-one, and another to write it using dictonary like T9 somedays.

## Why I create this?
It was a simple idea how to write a note on my smartphone without looking at the screen. You have a idea or a thing to check later and you will not forget it. So by pressing a buttons somewhere , you save a note fast and often unnoticable. These buttons can by on the phone cover or for example on side of your leg.
